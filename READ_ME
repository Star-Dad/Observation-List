Hello fellow astronomers!

I do a lot of outreach programs in various locations and it sometimes takes me an hour or more to build a plan for observing based on the topology of the area I will be setting up equipment.  What I most value is the alt/az information of objects followed by magnitude (light pollution is always a factor).  So I've written a small program that reads a flat file listing of M/NGC/IC objects and a separate file that contains some basic information and a list of objects I'm interested in observing.  It then outputs an html file for printing to be used in the field.  I do plan on making improvements and adding more objects such as double stars in the future.  I also forsee using it to generate output for my AstroPhotography sessions.  You will need to get the original data files from: 

https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/ngc2000.html and click on the link to: <VII/118/ngc2000.dat>

Steps to run

create an ASCII/text file - name it what you will - I tend to use dates and names of places like 2022-06-01_West_ Thompson_Dam

insert in the file the following  change the actual data to what ever you want:
_____________________
year 2022
month 6
date 1
zone -4
hour 21
minute 30
latitude 41.525
longitude -72.075
min_alt 30

NGC457
M44
M67
M81
M82
M97
_________________

Note:  zone is your time zone relative to GMT or UT
latitude and longitude are your observing coordinates
min_alt is the minimum height/altitude in degrees below which no objets will be listed. - in other words in most cases the angle of the tree line or other obstructions.
The entire file IS CASE SENSISTIVE.

After the 9 information fields you then list the objects you want to be potentially listed in the output file.  I have a book "Star Watch" by Philip S Harrington that lists objects by seasons and "WOW!" factor that I use for observing/outreach.  I pull most of my objects from his book.

The program will request the file name for input (the above file you've created) and then generate the output file and in less than a second on my machine. I then send it to the printer after reviewing it.  Voila'  Note the output file name ends with a .html

The program is written entirely in C and the code is provided.  I run it on linux although I'm sure it can be compiled on any OS that can compile C.  I plan on recompiling it for the venerable Amiga 3.1 OS which many folks are STILL using.  :*D
